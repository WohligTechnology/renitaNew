                  All consultations and treatments are to be paid for, BEFORE availing the service. This is to avoid ambiguity and / or surprise
                  later on.

                  For procedures that involve blocking a time slot of more than 30 minutes, a non refundable advance has to be made to book
                  the slot. This is to avoid no shows/ delayed arrivals, which in turn upsets the schedule of the day, causing
                  delays to other patients/ clients.
